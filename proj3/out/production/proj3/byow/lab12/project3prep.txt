Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the world and the paths on the Project 3 side?

A: The hexagon is the rooms and the tesselation is creating them. I  can't think of an anlogy though.

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A:  I would begin by writing a simply a method to generate one room suchas the addhexagon method.

-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A: Rooms and hallways must have walls that are visually distinct from floors. Walls and floors should be visually distinct from unused spaces.
   Rooms and hallways should be connected, i.e. there should not be gaps in the floor between adjacent rooms or hallways.
   Hallways have constant heigh but different length.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A: Their used many helped methods to divide the tasks mine didn't. This made the code more organized and easy to understand.

-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A:  I think the algorything needs to generate the room with a random hallways attached to it, and the next one needs to be built on that hallway randomly.
